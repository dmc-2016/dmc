    "That looks pretty good! You can see that the RNN has learned alot of the linguistic structure of the original writing, including typical length for words, where to put spaces, and basic punctuation with commas and periods. Many words are still misspelled but seem almost reasonable, and it is pretty amazing that it is able to learn this much in only 50 epochs of training. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can see that the loss is still going down after 50 epochs, so the model can definitely benefit from longer training. If you're curious you can try to train for more epochs, but as the error decreases be careful to monitor the output to make sure that the model is not overfitting. As with other neural network models, you can monitor the difference between training and validation loss to see if overfitting might be occuring. In this case, since we're using the model to generate new information, we can also get a sense of overfitting from the material it generates.\n",
    "\n",
    "A good indication of overfitting is if the model outputs exactly what is in the original text given a seed from the text, but jibberish if given a seed that is not in the original text. Remember we don't want the model to learn how to reproduce exactly the original text, but to learn its style to be able to generate new text. As with other models, regularization methods such as dropout and limiting model complexity can be used to avoid the problem of overfitting.\n",
